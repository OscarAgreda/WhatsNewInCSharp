# C# Language Features Solution

This solution contains a collection of C# Console applications, each of which demonstrates a different C# language feature. The purpose of this solution is to provide a comprehensive learning resource for students who want to learn C# language features and best practices. By examining the code examples in each project, students can gain a deeper understanding of how to use the features of the C# language in real-world scenarios. The projects cover a broad range of features, from basic language constructs such as string manipulation and switch statements, to more advanced concepts such as async programming, pattern matching, and DDD using Clean Architecture. With this solution, students will be able to develop a strong foundation in C# programming, and be better equipped to write high-quality, maintainable code that follows best practices.

The solution includes a wide range of C# features, including:

Asynchronous Disposable

Async Method Builder

Async Streams

Auto Default Structs

Caller Argument Expression

Const Interpolated Strings

Default Interface Methods

Enhanced Line Pragma

Extended Nameof Scope

Extended Property Patterns

File-local Types

Generic Attributes

Generic Math Support

Improvements of Structure Types

Init Only Setters

Interpolated String Handlers

Lambda Improvements

List Pattern

Method Group Conversion

Native Sized Integers

Newlines in String Interpolation Expressions

Nullable Reference Types

Null Coalescing Assignment

Pattern Matching

Pattern Matching Enhancements

Raw String Literals

Records

Record Structs

Required Members

Static Local Functions

Suppress LocalsInit Flag

Target Typed New Expressions

Using Declarations

Utf8 String Literals


Each console application includes a detailed description of the C# feature, code examples, and best practices for using the feature. This solution is designed to be used as a self-paced learning resource for students who want to learn C# features before diving into C# clean architecture under domain-driven design.

Getting Started
To get started, clone or download the repository, and open the solution in Visual Studio. Each console application is contained in a separate project within the solution, and can be run independently to demonstrate the respective C# feature.
